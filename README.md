This was a beginning of a crypto information hub but while doing it the API i was using drastically changed it's free tier which in turn made me loose interest in the entire project. Thus the only thing implemented is the gnomics API wrapper and nothing more. It's still a good resource for Go project file structure and some somewhat decent wrapper library design choices.
